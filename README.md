## Front-end for Seamer Design website using Gatsby, Sanity & Emotion.
The website was never finished, as it was put on hold during a busy month of business. When we went back to it, the owner wanted to change the whole design, so we decided to scrap the project and start new.

The staging site can be viewed here https://seamerfrontend.gtsb.io
